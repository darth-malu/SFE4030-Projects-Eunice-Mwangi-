+ Dependency inversion
  Is a key principle of SOLID
  
  It talks about coupling between different classes or modules

  It focuses on the approach where the higher classes are not dependent on the lower classes but instead
    depend upon the abstraction of the lower classes.

  The main motto of dependency inversion is:

  #+begin_quote
  Any higher classes should always depend upon the abstraction of the class rather than the detail
  #+end_quote

  

+ encapsulation
+ polymorphism
